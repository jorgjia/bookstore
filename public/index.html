      <h3>First</h3>
      <p>The Bookstore is proud to continue to be a vibrant part of the Glen Ellyn community, as it has been for over 50 years. Generations of readers started out at our store, and many bring their own children and grandchildren back to enjoy the down-to-earth comfort of a real old-fashioned bookstore. We will always love the look and feel of printed books. Neverthless, we look forward to a bright future in which we continue to help our customers find the perfect read, in any format they choose..</p>

      <h3>1960-1973</h3>
      <p >Bookstore was founded by Vic and Rosamond Du Jardin prior to 1960, but moved to its current storefront at 475 N. Main Street in Glen Ellyn sometime in 1960. The old brick building dates back to 1892, and was originally home to McChesney's General Store. When McChesney's moved out, they left behind an old safe that looks like it belongs in a wild west movie. We still use that safe today, and include it on our historical tours for children. At that time The Bookstore occupied a double storefront, including the space that now houses our neighborhood knitting shop, String Theory Yarn Co. </p>

      <h3>1973-1987</h3>        
      <p>k and Marguerite Rice purchased The Bookstore from the Du Jardins in 1973. The south half of the store was made into a record shop, and The Bookstore was limited to the north half. According to their son David Rice, it was named "The Book Store - M. Rice - Prop. 1973" in order to hearken back to the small town stores his parents had known in their youth. David remembers many New Year's Days spent doing end-of-the-year inventory at the Book Store with his extended family, watching bowl games on a portable TV they'd set up in the store. David speaks fondly of his time spent as co-manager on and off throughout the 1980's, enjoying the camaraderie with fellow booksellers. Camaraderie with fellow readers is still the key to The Bookstore's success over 30 years later.</p>
